This is my portfolio page. I mainly work on Android and have a little experience on web front-end.

### &#8211; Android

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>1. Various Animation Practice</strong>
</p>

  * This is an practice application that imitates various animation in several famous apps, like Facebook and KakaoStory, etc. It implemented Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;Like&#8221; button animation and KakaoStory&#8217;s writing button animation and so on.
  * You can download the [apk file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ui6gjahzgh5w69b/VariousAnimationPractice.apk) (or shortened url: http://goo.gl/0jXXlz), and see the [source code here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ggypp3ixl668tx2/AACfVDh__8Mref7I3GC21bqUa).
  * I referred [a git repo](https://github.com/daCapricorn/ArcMenu), <span class="author">daCapricorn&#8217;s </span>ArcMenu, which implemented &#8220;Path&#8221; style button for KakaoStory button.

  <strong>2.  KakaoTalk Practice (in progress)</strong>
</p>

  * This is an practice application that imitates KakaoTalk application with Kakao SDK. It tries to mimic every user interface and user flow in KakaoTalk as much as possible. But I haven&#8217;t finished it yet.
  * I used Kakao SDK, and two git repos, [<span class="author">nostra13&#8217;s </span>Android-Universal-Image-Loader](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader) and <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://github.com/square/otto">square&#8217;s otto</a>.</span>
  * You can download the [apk file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ev5axm0094s3q9f/KakaoPractice.apk) (or shortened url: http://goo.gl/MpKRFF), and see the [source code here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9dbmt81fcqtpakt/AAARjHIreY_gOeg631KfzZ5ca).

  <strong>1. Book intro website</strong>
</p>

  * This is a website that showcases a book that I wrote, (&#8220;어떻게 창업하셨습니까?&#8221;, 21세기북스, 2014, Seoul) with its key concept and recommendation it has received.
  * I developed it with AWS, Heroku, and used Node.js for server-side and Bootstrap for css.
  * The Address is : <http://tranquil-earth-3871.herokuapp.com> (shortened url : http://goo.gl/B2LKxw)
